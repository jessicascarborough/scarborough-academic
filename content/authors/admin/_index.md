Jessica Scarborough is a third year medical student in the combined MD/PhD Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). She defended her PhD in March 2022, and she is now planning to apply into Internal Medicine for residency with the goal of pursuing a Hematology/Oncology Fellowship. During her PhD, Jessica had the privilege of working in the Theory Division Laboratory, at Cleveland Clinic's Lerner Research Institute, which is lead by Dr. Jacob Scott. There, her research interests included the extraction of biomarkers to predict therapeutic response in cancer and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying collateral sensitivity and resistance in cancer treatment. She is passionate about translational science improving the lives of patients and completed a Translational Fellowship at CWRU to gain insight into the entrepreneurial skills required to move technologies from bench to bedside.
